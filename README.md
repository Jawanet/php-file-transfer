# php-file-transfer
Can transfer larga file, eg cPanel to cPanel


It allows you to transfer large files from one server to another by breaking up the file into 1MB pieces to avoid memory limits.
There seems to be a 2GB maximum on transfer sizes.

Upload and run the script with web browser on your new server.
